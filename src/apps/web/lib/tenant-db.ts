/**
 * Tenant database context for Postgres Row-Level Security (defense-in-depth
 * behind the app-layer practiceId filters).
 *
 * RLS policies key off the `app.current_practice_id` GUC. Because postgres-js
 * pools connections, the GUC must be set on the SAME connection that runs the
 * queries — so we set it inside a transaction (set_config(..., true) = local to
 * the tx) and hand the transaction handle to the callback.
 *
 * On the owner DB role (used in dev/self-host) RLS is bypassed, so these
 * wrappers are a harmless no-op there. Enforcement activates when the app
 * connects as the least-privilege role (see packages/db/rls/enable-rls.sql).
